There's no need to add extra quotes around values.</p> <p>Special Cases</p> <p>A few settings are handled separately since they do not use simple key-value pairs:</p> <p>1. CACHE</p> <p>You can use the following environment variables to customize the caching backend used by <code>seahub</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>SEAHUB__CACHE_BACKEND</code> (<code>memcached</code> or <code>redis</code>; default is <code>memcached</code>)</li> <li><code>SEAHUB__CACHE_HOST</code></li> <li><code>SEAHUB__CACHE_PORT</code></li> </ul> <p>There's no necessity to modify these values if you use the provided <code>seafile-pe.yml</code> file.</p> <p>2. DATABASE</p> <p>You can use the following environment variables to customize the database accessed by <code>seahub</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>DB_HOST</code> (default is <code>mariadb</code>)</li> <li><code>DB_ROOT_PASSWD</code></li> </ul> <p>3. SAML Attribute Mapping</p> <p>Seafile requires you to specify the attribute mapping when using SAML. You can use environment variables prefixed with <code>SEAHUB__SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING__</code> in order to do this.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>SEAHUB__SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING__name=display_name\nSEAHUB__SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING__mail=contact_email\n</code></pre> <p>This would generate the following configuration block inside <code>seahub_settings.py</code>:</p> <pre><code>SAML_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING = {\n    'name': ('display_name', ),\n    'mail': ('contact_email', ),\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Usually there is no need to make any changes to this file. Therefore it is currently not possible to customize this file. The file is overwritten on each restart.</p> <p>It is currently not possible to customize this file. The file is overwritten on each restart.</p> <p>NGINX listens on port 80. There should always be a reverse proxy in front of it that also handles TLS termination (e.g. Caddy).</p> <p>Just add a key value pair to the <code>.env</code> and run <code>docker compose up -d</code>.
