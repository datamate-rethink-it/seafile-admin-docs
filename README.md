Welcome to the Seafile Admin Docs Repository! 🌊🔍✨

This repository serves as the foundational source for the Seafile Admin Manual available at https://github.com/datamate-rethink-it/seafile-admin-docs/. This admin manual is generated with the help of MkDocs Material and hosted on Github Pages. It is a comprehensive guide and resource hub for administrators to install, configure and maintain their own Seafile Server **with a new developyment approach using only environment variables**.
