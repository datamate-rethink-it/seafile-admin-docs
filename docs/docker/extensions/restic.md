# Restic Backup

Running your own server always requires a reliable backup to secure your data. With this backup container, obtaining a daily backup is easy. We chose the backup software Restic for its numerous advantages:

- **Target:** Restic supports multiple backup targets, including S3, Backblaze, BorgBase, Dropbox, and Google Drive.
- **Speed:** Backup your data at lightning speed.
- **Encryption:** Your data is securely encrypted. Without the encryption key, it remains inaccessible.
- **Deduplication:** Duplicate files or file fragments are saved only once, reducing the amount of data transmitted.
- **Snapshots:** Forget about regular full backups; only the changes since the last backup need to be saved.
- **Reliability:** With 24k stars on GitHub and nearly a decade of development, restic is exceptionally robust.

## Installation

This article explains how to implement a restic backup for your Seafile server.

#### Change the .env file

To install the restic backup container, include `restic.yml` in the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable within your `.env` file. This instructs Docker to download the required images.

Simply copy and paste (:material-content-copy:) the following code into your command line:

```bash
sed -i "s/COMPOSE_FILE='\(.*\)'/COMPOSE_FILE='\1,restic.yml'/" /opt/seafile-compose/.env
```

#### Configure your backup

Every backup is encrypted with a password. Please make sure that you store this password at a save place, otherwise your backup will be worthless if you might need it.

```bash
pw=$(pwgen -s 40 1) && echo "Generated restic password: ${pw}"
```

The generated restic password needs to be added to your `.env` file. Copy and paste the following command:

```bash
echo -e "\n# restic-backup" >> /opt/seafile-compose/.env
echo "RESTIC_PASSWORD=${pw}" >> /opt/seafile-compose/.env
```

!!! tip "Local Backups are better then no backups"

    This configuration will create daily snapshots including database dumps at your host system at `/opt/restic/local`. This is a good start, but of cause we recommend that you store your backup remotely.

??? success "Secure offsite backup with BorgBase"

    For small Seafile servers, we could recommend the service BorgBase. They offer up to 10GB of Backup storage for free and the setup can be done in one minute.

    1. Register at <https://borgbase.com>.
    2. Create a new repo, choose any name and set the **Repo Format: Restic**.
    3. Save the provided **repository url** and use it as `RESTIC_REPOSITORY`.

    ![repository url from borgbase](../../assets/images/backup_with_borgbase_repository.png)

    This is all that is necessary to create a secure offsite backup.

#### Other backup targets

To use another backup target then the local path `/opt/restic/local` you have to provide the additional environment variable `RESTIC_REPOSITORY`. Some backends require additional environment variables for authentication.

Here are some examples. For more details, refer to the [official restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/).

=== "REST Server"

    ```bash
    RESTIC_REPOSITORY='rest:https://user:pass@host/'
    ```

=== "Amazon S3"

    ```bash
    RESTIC_REPOSITORY='s3:s3.amazonaws.com/bucket_name'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='...'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...'
    ```

=== "Backblaze B2"

    ```bash
    RESTIC_REPOSITORY='s3:s3.amazonaws.com/bucket_name'
    B2_ACCOUNT_ID='...'
    B2_ACCOUNT_KEY='...'
    ```

=== "rclone"

    rclone is already installed in the backup container and expects the configuration file at `/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`. Generate your rclone.conf at the host and mount it to the container at this location. Then you can use restic with rclone as described in the manual.

    ```bash
    volumes:
        ...
        - /opt/restic/rclone.conf:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf:ro
    ```

    ```bash
    RESTIC_REPOSITORY='rclone:xxx:yyy'
    ```

## Start the backup

Now it is time to load the container and start the backup for the first time.

```bash
cd /opt/seafile-compose && \
docker compose up -d
```

Afterwards check the logs for more details.

```bash
docker logs restic-backup
```

The output might look like this:

```console
[2024-05-17 16:16] Starting the restic backup container ...
[2024-05-17 16:16] Restic repository '/local' does not exists.
  Running restic init.
  created restic repository 7982e3a700 at /local

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository
Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.
[2024-05-17 16:16] Setup backup cron job with cron expr. BACKUP_CRON: 20 2 * * *
[2024-05-17 16:16] Setup check cron job with cron expr. CHECK_CRON: 40 3 * * 6
[2024-05-17 16:16] Container started successful.
  The restic repository is initialized, cron daemon runs...
  Ready for backup!
```

:material-party-popper: **Perfect!** Your backup was initialized and will run every day at 2.20am.
