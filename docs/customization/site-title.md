# Site Title and Site Name

**Site Title** and **Site Name** are two basic customization options. The **Title** is used in the browser tab and the **Name** is used in notifications or email messages.

## Configuration via environment variables

Add these configurations to your `/opt/seafile-compose/.env` file and restart the seafle container.

```
SEAHUB__SITE_TITLE="My private seafile cloud"
SEAHUB__SITE_NAME="My private seafile cloud"
```
