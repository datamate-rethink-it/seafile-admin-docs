# How to get started

Now it is time to start with the installation. Installing Seafile is straightforward, with two deployment options available:

## Docker Deployment

This is the default and recommended method, ideal for most users. Docker simplifies the setup process, making it quick and easy to get Seafile up and running.

[Start the docker deployment](../docker/concept.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Kubernetes Deployment:

This option is suitable if you already have a Kubernetes cluster, are familiar with Kubernetes, and wish to deploy Seafile as part of a clustered environment. Kubernetes should only be considered if these conditions apply.
